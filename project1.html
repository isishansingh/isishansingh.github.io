    <p>This project showcases my personal portfolio, built to highlight my skills, projects, and background as a CSE student. The website is designed to be responsive, modern, and visually appealing.</p>
    <p>I implemented smooth navigation, structured sections, and interactive project cards. The goal was to demonstrate clean design and usability while keeping the code simple.</p>
    <p>The project also allowed me to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic responsive design principles. I focused on creating a consistent color palette, readable typography, and intuitive layout.</p>
    <p>Each section is designed to convey my skills, educational background, and projects in a concise manner. Hover effects and clickable links were added for interactivity.</p>
    <p>The website is fully mobile-friendly, ensuring users can view it on different devices without any issue. This project is a reflection of my ability to combine functionality with aesthetics.</p>
    <p>Future improvements could include adding animations, dynamic content, and integration with APIs to make the website even more interactive and engaging.</p>
    <p>Overall, this project helped me understand project structuring, layout planning, and responsive design strategies effectively.</p>
