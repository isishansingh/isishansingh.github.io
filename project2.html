    <p>This Weather App provides real-time weather information for any location using an open weather API. It features a clean interface with easy-to-read temperature, humidity, and wind data.</p>
    <p>The app was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on asynchronous API calls and data rendering. Users can search for cities and instantly get current weather updates.</p>
    <p>Interactive UI elements like dynamic icons, background color changes, and responsive layouts enhance the user experience.</p>
    <p>This project helped me understand API integration, JSON parsing, and front-end logic implementation. I also practiced error handling for invalid inputs.</p>
    <p>Future updates may include adding hourly forecasts, user location detection, and improved animations for weather conditions.</p>
    <p>By working on this project, I gained confidence in building practical applications that fetch and display data in real time.</p>
    <p>The project demonstrates my ability to combine API knowledge with front-end skills for a complete functional application.</p>
